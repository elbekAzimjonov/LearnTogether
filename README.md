![Learn Together UI](https://github.com/elbekAzimjonov/LearnTogether/blob/master/ui.png)

This repository contains the implementation of the "Learn Together" app's article screen, built as part of a Google Android Codelab exercise. The app showcases a list of articles about various Jetpack libraries, allowing users to select topics and learn about the latest developments.

## Project Overview

In this exercise, we focus on building a screen dedicated to a tutorial on Jetpack Compose. This project demonstrates how to create a simple UI component using Jetpack Compose's declarative functions.

## Features

- **Jetpack Compose Tutorial**: Learn about Jetpack Compose, a modern toolkit for building native Android UIs. Compose simplifies UI development with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.
  
- **Declarative UI**: The tutorial emphasizes the use of Composable functions, which describe the UI programmatically and manage data dependencies.

## Getting Started

To explore the project and see the Compose article screen in action, clone the repository and open it in Android Studio.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elbekAzimjonov/LearnTogether.git
```
