Learn Together App: Compose Article Screen
This repository contains the implementation of the "Learn Together" app's article screen, built as part of a Google Android Codelab exercise. The app showcases a list of articles about various Jetpack libraries, allowing users to select topics and learn about the latest developments.

Project Overview
In this exercise, we focus on building a screen dedicated to a tutorial on Jetpack Compose. This project demonstrates how to create a simple UI component using Jetpack Compose's declarative functions.

Features
Jetpack Compose Tutorial: Learn about Jetpack Compose, a modern toolkit for building native Android UIs. Compose simplifies UI development with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.
Declarative UI: The tutorial emphasizes the use of Composable functions, which describe the UI programmatically and manage data dependencies.
